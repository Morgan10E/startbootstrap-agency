All aspects of the internet, including the physical data centers of the Cloud, have remained highly unregulated. There is no government body in place to monitor data centers, and they remain highly secretive. In fact, the government itself has very little knowledge of its own data centers. With the cyberlibertarian mindset, many tech companies can think that the government should stay out of the internet, even the physical manifestations of the internet. From this mindset, companies can feel justified in everything - even violating clean air regulations, because the rules shouldn’t apply to them. The environmental impact of their actions isn’t even on their radar - only profits.</p>

                                Data centers are run at 100% around the clock, regardless of demand, to protect against a sudden surge of users slowing down the systems. This results in these centers wasting at least 90 percent of the energy they pull off the grid. A diagnosis of LexisNexis servers revealed that three-quarters of sampled servers were using ten percent of their computational power<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup>. This is not considered unusual for the industry.
                                If a data center is sluggish or shuts down, it can cost someone their career. Even though utilization up to 96.4 percent has been proven possible<sup><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup>, few are willing to risk the transition.

                                In one particular case, energy usage was used as a weapon. A Microsoft data center in Quincy, WA had overestimated their energy usage and was subject to a $210,000 fine. Rather than pay the fine, Microsoft began running giant heaters for no purpose in order to burn energy before the deadline. If they could get within their prediction margin, they would have incurred $70,000 in energy costs, but would have saved $140,000 overall. Microsoft informed the utility that this would be their course of action unless they saw a reduction in the fine. The utility board ultimately reduced the fine to $60,000.

                                                Do companies have a duty to provide reliably fast service to their customers? Or do companies have a duty to protect the environment, or at least not be wasteful in their energy usage? If companies’ first responsibility is to their customers, then one can argue that keeping their servers running at all times is ethically justified. However, if companies’ first responsibility is to be energy efficient, then their actions are ethically wrong. If they have a duty to achieve some combination of reliable service to their users and energy efficiency, then companies have a moral obligation to increase their utilization. From the deontological perspective, Microsoft’s energy wasting would never be justified.

                                                The utilitarian perspective has many factors to consider. Is the low utilization better for companies, since it lowers risk and they don’t have to invest in improvements? Or would higher utilization be better, since it would lower energy costs? Does the wasting of energy ultimately subtract from overall happiness, since environmental damage is bad for health? Can the happiness of the environment itself be considered a factor? Does the happiness of the company outweigh the happiness of the utilities or the environment? Depending on how one answers these questions, the low utilization and Microsoft’s actions may or may not be supported by the utilitarian perspective.

                                With cooling "accounting for approximately 37 percent of electricity usage within a well-designed data center", it's natural place to look at minimizing energy usage. Currently, most corporations use one of two methods CRACs or CRAH's. CRACs (computer room air conditioners) tower server rooms and simply chill the air to let servers operate at a comfortable temperature. CRAHs (computer room air handlers) operate similarly, but cool servers using chilled water. The chilled water is then pumped through coils and take away the heat from the server rooms.

                                Current cooling methods are inefficient because they use air as the main medium to coolthe servers. Air being a poor conductor of heat means a lot of energy is wasted chilling the air in the CRAC and CRAH units. Liquid immersion technology aims to cut down on energy efficiency be directly chilling servers with cold liquid. However, liquids such as water may lead to fast corrosion of server machinery. Instead, specially engineered mineral oils may be the key to keeping servers operational for longer.

                                Corporations are looking to drive down cooling costs through innovative means. Google, in particular, purchased a unique site in Finland for a green and efficient data center. Originally a paper mill, Google sought to take advantage of the naturally cool seawater near the location. Addressing one of the big costs of cooling (chilling the water in CRAH's) brought about its own set of challenges. Unlike regular water, seawater is particularly corrosive. Furthermore, the heated seawater couldn't simply be returned to the sea at such a high temperature without disturbing the surrounding environment. The solution was two-fold. First, titanium plates became the filter of choice with their natural resistance to corrosion. Second, the heated exhaust water would be mixed in with fresh, cool seawater before being returned to the sea. Google's Finland plant is an example of green initiatives taking place in data center cooling.

So long as companies continue to act in such a way, they are ethically justified from the deontological perspective.
